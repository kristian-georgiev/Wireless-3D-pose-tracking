# Wireless-3D-pose-tracking
Advanced systems have been developed to enable accurate room-scale 3D tracking for virtual reality applications. Steam has recently made these tools available for community development (https://partner.steamgames.com/vrlicensing, https://www.triadsemi.com/steamvr-tracking/). These tools can be leveraged to enable wireless 6-degree of freedom tracking of freely moving animals for experimental neuroscience.  This would provide a large number of benefits compared to current video-based tracking technology and would likely become the _de-facto gold-standard method in the field, once implemented. A functional system requires the development of calibration and sensor fusion algorithms to combine 15-60Hz room-scale optical tracking with 500Hz local inertial reference frame data. This UROP would focus on the development and verification of these algorithms in a high level programming language and then implementing them on existing head-borne FPGAs and microcontrollers being used in the Wilson lab for behavioral research.
